	* src/configuration.c, src/dradio.c, src/dradio.h, src/gui.c: Make sure
	no zombie mplayer process is left behind, if errors occur while parsing

	the mplayer popup window when streaming TV or playing video podcasts.

	update in the title/icon of the terminal. It would be more useful if it was
	the currently playing track, but DR does not post metadata in their streams.

	* configure.ac, configuration.c, mplayer.c: Removed all the
	rtsp-stream-over-tcp/libliveMedia stuff and replaced the rtsp://
	streaming TV links with mms:// links. It is still possible to play
	the H264 streams, just start DRadio with -rtsp-stream-over-tcp as
	an mplayer pass-thru option, e.g. 'dradio -rtsp-stream-over-tcp'. Thanks
	to Tomas Groth for the suggestion.

	'q', ESC and CLOSE_WIN keys/button from quit to stop, so the TV popup
